Objective: Design and generate the HTML, CSS, and JavaScript code for a personal portfolio website for a BCA (Bachelor of Computer Applications) student currently learning data science.  The website should be clean, modern, and mobile-responsive.

Target Audience: Recruiters, potential employers, and collaborators in the fields of software development and data science.

Content & Sections:

Homepage:
A brief and engaging introduction about the student (name, current BCA program, aspirations in data science).
A professional headshot.
A concise summary of skills (programming languages, tools, technologies). Highlight any data science related skills (e.g., Python, R, SQL, machine learning libraries).
Call to action buttons (e.g., "View Projects," "Contact Me," "Download Resume").
About Me:
A more detailed description of the student's background, academic journey, and passion for data science. Mention any relevant coursework, projects, or extracurricular activities related to data science.
Personal interests (optional, but can help personalize the site).
Projects:
Showcase projects the student has worked on, especially those related to data science. For each project:
Project title.
Brief description of the project and its purpose.
Technologies used.
Link to the project repository (GitHub, GitLab, etc.) if available. If the project is not publicly hosted, consider including screenshots or a short video demonstration.
Key accomplishments and learnings from the project.
Skills:
List technical skills, categorized (e.g., Programming Languages, Data Science Tools, Databases, Web Development). Include proficiency level (e.g., Beginner, Intermediate, Proficient) for each skill.
Examples: Python (Intermediate), SQL (Beginner), Machine Learning (Beginner), HTML (Proficient), CSS (Intermediate), JavaScript (Beginner), Git (Intermediate), Tableau (Beginner).
Resume:
A downloadable version of the student's resume (PDF format preferred).
Contact:
A contact form for visitors to reach out.
Links to social media profiles (LinkedIn, GitHub, etc.).
Design & Aesthetics:

Clean and Modern: Prioritize a minimalist and uncluttered design.
Mobile Responsive: Ensure the website looks good and functions well on all devices (desktops, tablets, and smartphones).
Color Scheme: Suggest a professional and visually appealing color palette (e.g., blues and grays, or a combination that reflects the student's personality).
Typography: Choose clear and readable fonts.
Layout: Use a clear and intuitive layout that makes it easy for visitors to navigate the website.
Technical Requirements:

HTML, CSS, and JavaScript: Use standard web technologies. Consider using a CSS framework like Bootstrap or Tailwind CSS for easier styling and responsiveness.
Hosting: The generated code should be easily deployable to a web hosting service (e.g., Netlify, Vercel, GitHub Pages).
Example Project Descriptions (for guidance):

Project 1 (Data Science): "Predicting Customer Churn using Logistic Regression in Python. This project involved data cleaning, feature engineering, and model training to predict customer churn for a telecom company. Technologies: Python, Pandas, Scikit-learn."
Project 2 (Web Development): "Developing a To-Do List App using JavaScript. This project focused on front-end development and implementing interactive features using JavaScript. Technologies: HTML, CSS, JavaScript."
Output:

Provide the complete HTML, CSS, and JavaScript code for the portfolio website.  Include clear instructions on how to set up and deploy the website.  If possible, provide a live demo or a link to a preview of the website.

Bonus (Optional):

Suggest ways to improve the website's SEO (Search Engine Optimization).
Recommend free or affordable resources for hosting the website.
This detailed prompt should provide the AI with enough information to create a professional and effective portfolio website for a BCA student learning data science.  Remember to iterate and refine the output based on your specific needs and preferences.
